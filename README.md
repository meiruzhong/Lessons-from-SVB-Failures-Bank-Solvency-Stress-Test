# Lessons-from-SVB-Failures-Bank-Solvency-Stress-Test
According to the excellent article written by Professor Stephen Cecchetti, the SVB collapse revealed four
failures: risk management, market discipline, supervision, and resolution. I very much agree with this
conclusion and decided to conduct further analysis based on the stress test models to see if we as investors can
filter out those banks that need to be vigilant.


The failure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank can be sensed from the simple chart and scenario tests.
As the average market decline during the Covid was around 10%, Silicon Valley Bank obviously lacked the
capital to satisfy the depositorsâ€™ needs and absorbed the potential losses. Therefore, SVB shut down on March
10, 2023. Fueled by the panic in the bank run and crypto uncertainty, Signature Bank became the second to fail
two days later.
