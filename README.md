# SVB Failures: Liquidity Stress Test and Interest Rate Risk Analysis

The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) can mainly be boiled down to two reasons: Liquidity Risk and Interest Rate Risk. Why did the SVB bank run happen? That is because the depositors had lost confidence in the bank and were worried that they would not be able to get all their deposits back. Where did this concern come from? Why didn't the public trust SVB any more? Data helped us unveil the truth of the failure in SVB.

The lesson from the SVB bank run emphasizes the importance of managing liquidity risk and interest rate risks. With healthy and controllable internal systems, no matter how dark the economy will be, the bank still has the ability to go through.Whatâ€™s more, regulators should scrutinize banks' financial situations more carefully and rigorously and conduct stress tests to verify their resilience to prevent such cases from happening again.
